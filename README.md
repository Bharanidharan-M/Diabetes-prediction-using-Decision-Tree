# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

## 📄 Description

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a patient is diabetic based on diagnostic measurements. It uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, a well-known dataset in healthcare machine learning.

The classifier is trained to learn patterns from attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin, age, and more.
